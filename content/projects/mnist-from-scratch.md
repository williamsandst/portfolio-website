description: "A Machine Learning project which recognizes handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset with <b>97 % accuracy</b>. Written in Python using Numpy, completely from the ground up (no TensorFlow etc). Uses PyQT5 for a visual interface"
aim: "The aim of this project was implement a neural network from scratch to learn the fundamentals of machine learning. It also served as a learning opportunity for the GUI framework QT5"
