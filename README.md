## Implementation details
The website design is inspired by OpenAI's previous website, which used cards to represent projects. The CSS is mostly styled used Emotion. The projects and blog posts are written in Markdown. Various plugins have also been used to improve the website speed, such as gatsby-plugin-preact and a few more.
