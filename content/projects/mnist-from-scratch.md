description: "A Machine Learning project to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset with a 97 % accuracy. Written in Python using Numpy, completely from the ground up (no TensorFlow etc). Uses PyQT5 for a visual interface"
aim: "The aim of this project was implement a neural network from scratch to learn about machine learning. It also served as a learning oppertunity for the GUI framework PyQT5"
